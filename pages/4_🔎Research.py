The primary theory is that in-context examples help fine-tune the attention mechanism to focus on relevant tokens, enhancing the model's output accuracy. This is achieved without actual learning, as the model parameters remain unchanged but are better aligned with the expected output through the examples provided.](https://www.example.com)")
